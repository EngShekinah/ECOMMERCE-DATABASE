# ECOMMERCE-DATABASE
📦 Peer Group Assignment: E-commerce Database Design
🎯 Objective
This challenge will help you master the art of database design🧠💾
Your group will design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and collaboratively build an e-commerce database from scratch.

 

🛠️ Instructions
1️⃣ Create an ERD ✍️
Clearly define all entities (tables) and their attributes.
Understand and document the relationships between tables.
Identify primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Use tools like Lucidchart, draw.io, dbdiagram.io, or MySQL Workbench 🛠️
2️⃣ Plan the Data Flow 🔄
Map out how data flows between entities.
As a team, discuss how the database will be structured and implemented.
Think like architects! 🏗️

Here's a detailed mapping of the data flow for the e-commerce database, highlighting how information moves between different entities and processes:

1. User Interaction
   - Product Browsing: Users browse products by categories, colors, and sizes.
   - Search Functionality: Users search for specific products using keywords.

2. Data Input
   - Product Management Interface: Admins or vendors add new products through a dashboard.
     - Inputs:
       - Product details (name, brand, category, price)
       - Variations (size, color)
       - Images and attributes

3. Database Operations
   - Inserting Data:
     - When a product is added, data flows into the product, product_item, product_variation, product_image, and product_attribute tables.
   - Updating Data:
     - When stock levels change (e.g., after a purchase), the **product_item** table is updated.
     - If a product's attributes or details change, updates are made to the relevant tables (e.g., product, product_attribute).

4. Data Retrieval
   - Product Listings: 
     - When a user visits a category or searches for a product, the system retrieves data from:
       - product: Basic product details
       - product_item: Available items and stock
       - product_variation: Size and color options
       - product_image: Associated images
       - Dynamic Filtering: Based on user selections (e.g., color, size), the system dynamically filters products and returns the relevant items.

5. Order Processing
   - Cart Functionality: Users add items to their shopping cart.
     - The cart stores references to product_item entries.
   - Checkout:
     - During checkout, the system verifies stock levels from product_item.
     - If stock is available, the order is processed, and the stock quantity is updated.
     - Transaction data can be logged (not detailed here but could involve an orders table).

6. User Feedback
   - Reviews and Ratings: Users can leave feedback on products, which could be stored in a separate reviews table linked to product_item.

3️⃣ Group Collaboration 🤝
Work together on analysis, design, and implementation.
Everyone should understand every part of the project.
Share ideas, ask questions, and keep the teamwork strong! 💬
4️⃣ Submission 🚀
Create a public GitHub repository 📂
Upload your final ERD and ecommerce.sql file.
Ensure everything is accessible to the reviewer 🔍
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Group Collaboration Tips
Stay connected and meet regularly 👥
Use GitHub for version control, documentation, and teamwork 📘
Track your progress, share updates, and troubleshoot together 🔧
Make sure everyone is in the loop 🧭
 

🗃️ Tables to Be Created
You'll be building the following tables for your e-commerce platform 🛍️:

🖼️ product_image – Stores product image URLs or file references
🎨 color – Manages available color options
🗂️ product_category – Classifies products into categories (e.g., clothing, electronics)
📦 product – Stores general product details (name, brand, base price)
🧾 product_item – Represents purchasable items with specific variations
🏷️ brand – Stores brand-related data
🔄 product_variation – Links a product to its variations (e.g., size, color)
📏 size_category – Groups sizes into categories (e.g., clothing sizes, shoe sizes)
📐 size_option – Lists specific sizes (e.g., S, M, L, 42)
🧵 product_attribute – Stores custom attributes (e.g., material, weight)
📚 attribute_category – Groups attributes into categories (e.g., physical, technical)
🧪 attribute_type – Defines types of attributes (e.g., text, number, boolean)
